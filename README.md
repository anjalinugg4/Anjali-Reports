# reports-template

A template for using a GitHub repository as your location for weekly reports.

Please follow the GitHub documentation for [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

Here are some additional details:

- You can name the repository whatever you'd like, but keep in mind that it will only contain your reports.
- You can make your repository public or private. If you make it private please make sure to give me access.
- There is only one branch to this repository (so you can ignore the "Include all branches" option).

Once you have cloned the template, you will want to:

- Replace the contents of this README with your project proposal.
- Delete the example report (`git rm 2020-09-18-example`).
- Start creating your own reports, each in its own directory.
