|6/19 | tried sending commands through my OSC to Francisco's UE vehicle, experimented with taking screenshots via a UE vehicle camera, watched the W&B 101 video series
|6/20 | zoomed with team about packaging, sending commands through python files, created OSC blueprint to send commands to through python file, measured dimensions at Oldenborg, experimented with creating different levels in Sweet Home 3D

# Activities

- added nodes to the event graph to take screenshots

- this is where the screenshots are saved:

- OSC blueprint

- python files where we defined different functions and called them

- calling the functions themselves

- downloaded the files in a terminal and sent the messages to Unreal Engine

- saw the functions displayed on screen in Unreal Engine

# Issues
- displaying the messages in Unreal Engine and getting the blueprint to work; at first I wasn't seeing anything in the output log and had to refer back to earlier blueprints to mitigate this

-being able to see the ARCS Assets project and the Oldenborg model

- getting an accurate depiction of Oldenborg besides its wall dimensions (width of hallways, inclines, stairs, etc.)


# Plans

- create an accurate Oldenborg model to scale now that we gathered the measurements

# Article Summaries

- watched this helpful video that explains the components of neural networks - weight/bias/layers/activation: https://youtu.be/82_R6Sgiuo0
