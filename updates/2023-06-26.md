|6/19 | tried sending commands through my OSC to Francisco's UE vehicle, experimented with taking screenshots via a UE vehicle camera, watched the W&B 101 video series
|6/20 | zoomed with team about packaging, sending commands through python files, created OSC blueprint to send commands to through python file, measured dimensions at Oldenborg, experimented with creating different levels in Sweet Home 3D
|6/21 | went back to Oldenborg to gather additional dimensions/measurements, watched tutorials on how to package UE projects on a Mac, added blueprint feature that created a naming feature for screenshots taken in UE, looked into the Gibson Environment research paper/demos, navigating git pull requests to get my own copy of the python files on my machine, opened ARCS Assests project to play around with different textures and resolutions

# Activities

- added nodes to the event graph to take screenshots

- this is where the screenshots are saved:

- OSC blueprint

- python files where we defined different functions and called them

![Create function](/assets/2023-06-26/initfile.png)

- calling the functions themselves

![Call function](/assets/2023-06-26/callfunc.png)

- downloaded the files in a terminal and sent the messages to Unreal Engine

- saw the functions displayed on screen in Unreal Engine

- added blueprint feature that took screenshots in UE and followed a naming convention that can be used with our future datasets within the environment

- these are the nodes that I added to my OSC blueprin to 1. enable screenshots and 2. save them with the proper naming convention within my File Explorer

-Instructions for calling texture commands:
- Note before starting: MUST be in play mode to call the command.

In command line, type "ke * texture {int1} {int2}"

- forked the ue5osc repo to get a copy of the python files on my machine

# Issues
- displaying the messages in Unreal Engine and getting the blueprint to work; at first I wasn't seeing anything in the output log and had to refer back to earlier blueprints to mitigate this

-being able to see the ARCS Assets project and the Oldenborg model

- getting an accurate depiction of Oldenborg besides its wall dimensions (width of hallways, inclines, stairs, etc.)

- took a couple attempts to get the correct format of screenshots in Unreal Engine. I was initially dealing with white screens for screenshots instead of the image capture. This is one of the blueprints I was trying out that did not work

# Plans

- create an accurate Oldenborg model to scale now that we gathered the measurements

# Article Summaries

- watched this helpful video that explains the components of neural networks - weight/bias/layers/activation: https://youtu.be/82_R6Sgiuo0

- https://youtu.be/5fhFrnnwJgc: this video descibes how to create a slope in Sweet Home 3D
