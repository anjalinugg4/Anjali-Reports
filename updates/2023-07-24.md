# Activities

- changed screenshot filename convention to including the degrees truncated to the hundred-thousandth place; moving forward is indicated by 0, rotating right is negative degrees, and rotating left is positive degrees

```
        # Generate the next filename
        angle = str(self.navigator.target_angle).replace(".", "p")
        image_filepath = (
            f"{self.dataset_path}/"
            f"{self.images_saved:06}_{str(action).lower()}_{angle}.{str(self.image_ext).lower()}"
        )
```
```
# Already facing correct direction
        if abs(self.signed_angle_to_target) < self.half_target_wedge:
            action = Action.FORWARD
            self.target_angle = 0

        # Need to rotate left (think of unit circle); rotation indicated by positive degrees
        elif self.signed_angle_to_target > 0:
            action = Action.ROTATE_LEFT
            self.target_angle = f"{-self.signed_angle_to_target:+.2f}"

        # Need to rotate right (think of unit circle); rotation indicated by negative degrees
        else:
            action = Action.ROTATE_RIGHT
            self.target_angle = f"{-self.signed_angle_to_target:+.2f}"
```
