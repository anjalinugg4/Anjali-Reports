|7/17 | discussed iGibson paper with team, met with other RAs to go over boxnav code and how to create the conda environment
|7/18 | finished working on generating the screenshot filenames with Francisco, watched the Zoom recording of this morning's meeting about WandB artifacts, prepared for Wednesday's meeting with UCSC colleagues
|7/19 | did presentation and meeting with UCSC colleagues, worked on boxnav code with Francisco and added num_trials feature so that screenshots are not overridden with each trial run, created artifact with larger dataset

# Activities

- changed screenshot filename convention to including the degrees truncated to the hundred-thousandth place; moving forward is indicated by 0, rotating right is negative degrees, and rotating left is positive degrees

```
        # Generate the next filename
        angle = str(self.navigator.target_angle).replace(".", "p")
        image_filepath = (
            f"{self.dataset_path}/"
            f"{self.images_saved:06}_{str(action).lower()}_{angle}.{str(self.image_ext).lower()}"
        )
```
```
# Already facing correct direction
        if abs(self.signed_angle_to_target) < self.half_target_wedge:
            action = Action.FORWARD
            self.target_angle = 0

        # Need to rotate left (think of unit circle); rotation indicated by positive degrees
        elif self.signed_angle_to_target > 0:
            action = Action.ROTATE_LEFT
            self.target_angle = f"{-self.signed_angle_to_target:+.2f}"

        # Need to rotate right (think of unit circle); rotation indicated by negative degrees
        else:
            action = Action.ROTATE_RIGHT
            self.target_angle = f"{-self.signed_angle_to_target:+.2f}"
```

- watched the Zoom meeting about creating artifacts and was able to access the data through our WandB team files

- finished the slideshow presentation with Francisco, recorded a demo video of python OSC and boxnav code to show during tomorrow's meeting

# Issues
- tried to figure out how to not override screenshot images when you change the number of runs in the args parser to be anything greater than the default single run; mitigated this by adding a trial_num parameter to the simulate method and wrapper

- then added these lines of code to start at Trial 1 and restart the screenshot saving each time a new trial occurs without overriding previous images

```
    for trial in range(1, args.num_trials + 1):
        simulate(args, trial)
```
- worked with Francisco to make an artifact with a larger dataset

# Plans
- continue to make training datasets and artifacts, transition into testing
- meet again with Oliver to discuss intersections between our projects
- formulate plan for last week in the lab
