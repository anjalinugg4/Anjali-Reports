| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
|6/26 | read research paper and boxnav code
|6/27 | reviewed the boxnav code and took notes on concepts I was unfamiliar with
|6/28 | finished the Sweet Home 3D Model of Oldenborg (added stairs, ramps, ceilings), imported it into Blender to begin merging the different components that we'll manipulate in our dataset (floor, ceiling, walls), reviewed Francisco's code on dispatch/init involving sending commands between Python and Unreal Engine
|6/29 | helped Francisco debug python code, added delay function, made certain functions more concise, worked on argument parser and other functions in the demo/init file, began exploring Blender for an alternate Oldenborg model, analyzed the boxnav code and utilized certain components of the code in the osc python files 
|6/30 | met with team to discuss UE Blueprints/gitea process with ARCS Assets Project, continued to work with Francisco on making Prof Clark's edits, worked on building Oldenborg within Twinmotion

# Issues
- figuring out the most efficient way to add ceilings to the Oldy model

- doesn't appear to be an easy way to merge ceilings, walls, and floors seperately in Sweet Home 3D - the easiest thing to do might be to make the model in Blender which is more designed for this task

- navigating Blender

- issue with converting strings to floats when taking in the 3 arguments 

- debugging in general took a long time and getting acclimated to the code review process



# Plans

- make Oldenborg in Blender
- W&B course
- reread research paper and take notes on questions/thoughts I have
- complete SWOT questionnaire
- watch more Blender tutorial videos

# Article Summaries

BoxNav code notes:
- splits Oldenborg into a collection of boxes 
- we create arbritrary points for the robot to navigate to
- the math behind this involves normalizing vectors to a magnitude of 1
- to gather a more well-designed dataset, the robot wanders off the correct path in order to take screenshots of environments that are off in angle or direction
