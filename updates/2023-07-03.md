|6/26 | 
|6/27 | reviewed the boxnav code and took notes on concepts I was unfamiliar with
|6/28 | finished the Sweet Home 3D Model of Oldenborg (added stairs, ramps, ceilings), imported it into Blender to begin merging the different components that we'll manipulate in our dataset (floor, ceiling, walls), reviewed Francisco's code on dispatch/init involving sending commands between Python and Unreal Engine
|6/29 | helped Francisco debug python code, added delay function, made certain functions more concise, worked on argument parser and other functions in the demo/init file, began exploring Blender for an alternate Oldenborg model, analyzed the boxnav code and utilized certain components of the code in the osc python files

# Activities

- completed Oldenborg model

![Ramp](/assets/2023-07-03/ramp.png)

![Stairs](/assets/2023-07-03/stairs.png)

- argument parser within the demo code

```
def main():
    # Argument Parser that verifies that the image path is getting passed in
    parser = ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("path", type=str, help="Path to dataset.")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if args.path:
        print("File path:", args.path)
    else:
        print("No")
```

- debugged these functions within the init file:

```
    def save_image(self, pawn: int = 0) -> None:
        """Screenshot with default name"""
        self.client.send_message("/save/image", self.path)
        self.imgnumber += 1
        sleep(1)

    def request_image(self, pawn: int = 0) -> bytes:
        """request image we saved"""
        image = Image.open(f"{self.path}/Image_{self.imgnumber}.png")
        return image

    def show(self):
        """If matplotlib is being used, show the image taken to the plot"""
        plt.imshow(self.request_image())
```
# Issues
- figuring out the most efficient way to add ceilings to the Oldy model

- doesn't appear to be an easy way to merge ceilings, walls, and floors seperately in Sweet Home 3D - the easiest thing to do might be to make the model in Blender which is more designed for this task



# Plans

- make Oldenborg in Blender
- W&B course
- reread research paper and take notes on questions/thoughts I have

# Article Summaries

Questions on boxnav code:
- what does it mean to normalize a 2d vector?
