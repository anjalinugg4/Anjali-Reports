|7/3 | meet with team for an hour to make changes to the python files, discussed goals for the week/transition to Blender to build Oldenborg, debugged/improved python code with Francisco, continued to work on Blender model, completed SWOT form for one-on-one meeting, followed the WandB Artifact notebook and ran the code

# Activities

- read into WandB Artifacts
    - tool to track steps of machine learning model/datasets/results
    - tracks changes to the file so that all of us can access these modifications
    - You can store datasets directly in artifact (think of it like a directory of data)
    - when you change the contents in an artifact, W&B will create a new version of the artifact rather than overriding the previous contents
    - W&B creates an alias called "latest" which stores the newest artifact version (you can use indexes to refer to a specific artifact)
- played around with the code on W&B and ran into an error when adding a file to the artifact's contents. This is probably due to the fact that I don't have an actual dataset to add a file to

- continued progress on Blender Oldenborg model:

# Issues
- took me and Francisco a while to figure out why the wait for response function was broken. After trouble shooting, we figured out that self.values was continuously being set to "None" in the while loop, and could never break out of the loop. So, we assigned self.values to a non-None value to fix the function:

Fragment of handle_rotation function:

```
self.values = roll, pitch, yaw
return self.values
```

Now, the wait_for_response function can break out of the while loop:

```
 while not self.values:
        sleep(0.01)
    response = self.values
    self.values = None
    return response
```
- Getting the artifact code debugged while also navigating how it works in relation to our project

- Blender has a pretty steep learning curve, so I'm continuing to explore its different features and figuring out how to build Oldenborg most efficiently 



# Plans

- discuss research paper with team
- continue playing around with artifact code and share my findings with the team
- start creating datasets
- finish Oldenborg model
- continue with code review process with Prof Clark and Francisco
- prepare to meet with Oliver and his professor about what we've been working on/how we can best collaborate

# Article Summaries

BoxNav code notes:
- splits Oldenborg into a collection of boxes 
- we create arbritrary points for the robot to navigate to
- the math behind this involves normalizing vectors to a magnitude of 1
- to gather a more well-designed dataset, the robot wanders off the correct path in order to take screenshots of environments that are off in angle or direction
