|6/12 | built a UE vehicle with torque, animation, set up vehicle blueprint/skeletal mesh, created a physical asset
|6/13 | added inputs/adjusted torque and RPM to make vehicle move and turn
|6/14 | created seperate front/rear wheel blueprints to make wheels turn different directions, created archicad account, began experiementing with command+image/hybrid model learning, wrote function that sorts dataset based on number tag in string
|6/15 | continued to work on command + input code, zoomed with team, experimented with Arichicad/watched tutorial videos

# Activities

- created a wheel blueprint for eventually building a virtual robot within UE

# Issues
- ran into issues when setting up vehicle control inputs because UE says that action mappings deprecated so I can't add actual movements to the vehicle...working on mitigating this

- got wheels to move in the same direction, but trying to figure out how to get them to turn in opposite directions to create smoother movement

# Plans

- turming vehicle wheels different directions

# Article Summaries

- understanding yaw: yaw rotation around the yaw axis changes the direction that the vehicle is moving. Yaw rate/velocity represents the angular velocity of this rotation (radians/second)

- https://www.analyticsinsight.net/what-is-hybrid-machine-learning-and-how-to-use-it/ is a good read for understanding Hybrid Model Leraning (HML) before I tried to implement it in the 2ndRunHighRes dataset

-https://youtu.be/gyGVJeB77fA is a helpful tutorial for complete beginners to Archicad. Definitely a user friendly application that is a lot more intuitive than UE.

- was confused on what this class definition meant within the command + input code:

Prof Clark's diagram helped my understanding:
