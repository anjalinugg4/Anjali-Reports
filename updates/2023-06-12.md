| Date   | Notes
| :----- | :-------------------------------
|6/5| electronics project, read research publications, experimented with Prof Clark's datasets in jupyter notebook
|6/6 | zoomed with RAs about UE vs. TM, experimented with TM, worked with fastai, watched UE robotics tutorials
|6/7 | continued working with Twinmotion and fastai, watched Open Stage Control tutorials
|6/8 | built a new model using fastai tutorial that could distinguish between makeup products, followed Daisy's example in building a confusion matrix, continued Twinmotion work
|6/9 | Zoomed with research team about how to use UE, walked them through my model, discussed project goals/future tasks

# Activities

- jupyter notebook with Prof Clark's dataset

- followed the fastai lesson to build a model that can distinguish between images of mascara and lipstick products

# Issues

- navigating Twinmotion and getting used to the application
- building my own models using both Prof Clark's dataset/code and fastai's guide


# Plans

- data collection
- getting more practice with OSC

# Article Summaries

- research papers discussed the methodology of past models and what resulted in the best accuracy. I found the idea of storing the previous output of the model to be really interesting, as it allows the model to use past decisions to influence its further actions
