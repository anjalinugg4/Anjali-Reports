- building a Twinmotion project

# Issues

- navigating Twinmotion and getting used to the application


# Plans

- data collection

# Article Summaries

- research papers discussed the methodology of past models and what resulted in the best accuracy. I found the idea of storing the previous output of the model to be really interesting, as it allows the model to use past decisions to influence its further actions
