|7/24 | met with team to discuss progress/tasks for the rest of summer, worked on boxnav code with Francisco to fix the wandering path, added forward_increment to args parser, replied to Oliver regarding areas for collaboration in our research
|7/25 | met with team about progress with the tasks that we allocated in yesterday's meeting, research LiDAR data in preparation for follow-up meeting with Oliver, worked on loading in the First Training Model into inference.py with Francisco 
|7/26 | 

# Activities

- during our meeting on Monday, this is what we discussed: 
    - Need to work on inference.py to actually be able to make the agent act on our NN decisions.
        - Fix the wandering path to work as intended.
- Work on training.py to create a model that works with the Image+Command model.
    - Ella, Chau, and Daisy will work on getting the server GPU's working and coding an Image+Command model
    - Francisco and I will work on the boxnav wandering navigator and get it work as intended
- created a context manager within inference.py to complete these steps:
    - save an image
    - sleep while UE takes the image
    - read in the image file
    - pass the image into the neural network
    - neural network make a decision on which direction to go
```
    with Communicator(ip="127.0.0.1", ue_port=7447, py_port=7001) as osc_communicator:
        image_number += 1
        image_filepath = f"{file_path}/" f"{image_number:06}.jpg"

        osc_communicator.save_image(image_filepath)
        sleep(2.0)
        get_image(image_filepath)

        im = PILImage.create(image_filepath)

        # Remove the following line; no need to resize the image here
        # im = im.thumbnail((256, 256))

        predicted_direction, _, probs = learn.predict(im)
        print(f"We should go: {predicted_direction}")
        print(f"Probability we need to go {predicted_direction}: {probs[0]:.4f}")
```

# Issues
- downloading the training model into a pkl folder and getting it to work within inference.py

# Plans
- use image+command model on inference.py to see how our model performs
- meet again with Oliver to discuss collaboration


# Article Summaries

- What is LiDAR data? (Light Detection and Ranging)
    - used to create high-res models of ground elevation 
    - initially collected as "point cloud" of individual points reflected from everything on the surface
    - allows you to see the world in 3D by pulsing light waves into the surrounding environment 
    - can be used in assisting obstacle detection in autonomous driving
    - you can import point clouds into Unreal Engine and can be visualized for building realistic environments 
    - can capture real-time data which allows for the vehicles to change road conditions/obstacles
